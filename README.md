# The Project
A simple game written in TypeScript, HTML, CSS and React.

React was chosen for this project, as it provides a means for efficient data display and update on the frontend, which is required frequently in my application; the choice of React aids performance. This project also served as a way for me to learn React with the help of online resources, including StackOverflow, w3schools and even Reddit.

TypeScript was chosen over JavaScript for this project as I desired greater type safety for control, debugging and clarity purposes (learnt from previous projects).
